# Parallel Balanced Wheel-Leg Robot Project

A modern, responsive Vue 3 application showcasing our research project on Parallel Balanced Wheel-Leg Robot Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning.

## Project Overview

This project aims to improve the adaptability and movement efficiency of wheel-legged robots in complex terrain, with the following specific objectives:

1. **Design and build wheel-legged robots**: Develop an innovative wheel-legged robot with a 5-link balanced wheel-leg structure to improve stability and agility.

2. **Development of efficient control systems**: Implement a deep reinforcement learning based control system that enables autonomous locomotion strategy optimization.

3. **Enhancing terrain adaptation**: Enable the robot to maintain stable walking under different physical conditions and avoid obstacles effectively.

4. **Deploying control systems in edge computing environments**: Reduce latency and improve real-time responsiveness of the robot.
